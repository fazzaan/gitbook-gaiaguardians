# An Imaginarium

### An imaginarium is a place where raw ideas are seeded, where they can shoot, sprout, grow, reach for the light, absorb nutrients and be watered and cared for, where the atmosphere, temperature, soil quality are just right, and where they can be nurtured through different conditions and situations.

### Imaginarium chambers exist in a range of varieties, with different biomes & climates. There are even special antechambers with challenging conditions, to "weather" the ideas, give them a chance to develop strength and resilience. Some antechambers feature rapid time; others are highly electrically-charged; some are like the ocean floor.

### Imaginariums are interconnected by tubes, corridors, railways, ducts, cables, each of which carries certain transmissions. Some can transmit you as yourself, others transmit specific forms, which you may enter with the right mindset.

### You can only truly enter an imaginarium by fully immersing yourself in its environmental conditions. If you are not subject to its whim then how can you see what happens to the idealings?
