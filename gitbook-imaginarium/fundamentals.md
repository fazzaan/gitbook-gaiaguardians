# Fundamentals

There are some fundamentals of any layer of existence.

Physics, chemistry, biology. Gravity. Electricity. Water, and its life-bearing properties.

Cells. Replication. DNA.

Information, transmission of information, communication media.

Sound, voice, speech, language, words, phrases, expressions. Writing, symbols, script.

Events, relationships, history, memorial, tradition, respect, worship.

Deification, alienation.



We can notice these fundamentals, and we can challenge them.

We _should_ challenge them.

Such things form the raw fibres that the fabrics from which our cultures are woven.



## The questions

1. What fundamentals do we have?
2. Can they be challenged, replaced?
3. What affordances do they grant us, what do they allow us to believe and do?
4. Each plane has its own operating system (OS). What does each OS look like, before & after these fundamentals have been challenged, altered &/or replaced?
