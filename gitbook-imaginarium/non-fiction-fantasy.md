# Non-Fiction Fantasy

## Use worldbuildiŋ for exploring & constructing a positive future.

The concept and term _fantasy_ keeps the fantastical ideas firmly rooted in the unreal. This seems like both a psyop and a missed opportunity.

There's an entire genre just waiting to explode: bringing our dreams into reality!

We could be spending our time imagining a better world and creating semblances of it in our media. Indeed, we _should_ be doing this, because what our minds are filled with is what becomes real in the world — but, only if enough of us have the thoughts, and only if enough of us do something about it.

This is where the concept of _solidarity_ is important: yes, it means that you demonstrate your support for others who are struggling, but, you can transfer this meaning into this situation to understand the core issue:

> When people believe that nobody else has the same ideas as them, first they stop doing those things, then they stop talking about those things, and then they stop thinking about those things. The idea fades. And finally, once everyone has given up on it, the idea dies.

The concept of _solidarity_ can be useful here for the same reason: if we are all silent about our ideas for a better world, gradually most people will stop imagining such things, and will start to accept whatever the world throws at them.

## Use worldbuildiŋ to challenǧe issues.&#x20;

Issues that are present in today's world, and that are contained in dystopic stories. Such stories often do not challenǧe the issues in any useful way, which ends up reinforcing the issues, both for people who think that those issues are a _good_ thing, and for people who wish to change them. This is because the mind believes what the brain repeats, so if we are continually presented with the same set of information, a vast majority of us will become complacent, believing that that is the only range of possibilities.&#x20;

## Use worldbuildiŋ to make the reader challenge their fundamentals

Objects, tools, devices, regular daily objects like bottles, cutlery, lights, and more. These things derive from our history, and we can see different objects in different cultures, so it is likely that such objects in the world you're building would be somewhat different. This is applicable to absolutely everything.

When you design — or, perhaps, _discover_, and _evolve_ — the objects in your world, you can imagine them in such a way as to challenge the fundamentals of our own world. You could make entirely magical devices, and this is fine, but you could also make some which connect to alternative possibilities within our world.

Herein lies the reason why sci-fi is such a powerful communication device.&#x20;
