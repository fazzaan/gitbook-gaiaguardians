# Relics & special items

Imagine...

## Objects

Objects with special properties.

Providing you with: health, magic, power, cell activation (or suppression), EMF emission, shielding from EMF or force or something else.

Maybe these things look like magic, but actually provide their functions through a somewhat sensible mechanism.&#x20;

For example, perhaps there is an as-of-yet undiscovered harnessable energetic particle akin to the electron, but much more accessible and readily available — electricity generation and storage isn't necessary, as it is abundant throughout the fabric of space _and_ time and can simply be accessed from anywhere at any time. Devices utilizing such an energy source would appear as magic.&#x20;

This concept may challenge the reader's assumption about our own world that we have discovered everything and that we must solve our modern energy crisis through only the electrical paradigm.



## Materials

The objects are made of unusual materials, at least unusual to us. Are they impossible materials? Not necessarily.&#x20;

A self-healing paint was developed 10-15 years ago and is used on aeroplanes.&#x20;

What about a shiny, glassy material that is self-healing and also dirt-resistant, like hydrophobic materials? This would look shiny forever.

Crystals and gemstones are allowed to be in sci-fi fashion again, especially with modern research on things like encoding data in crystals with lasers. How about crystals which vibrate at a particular range of frequencies?, which maintain a sub-space connection to the parts from which they were hewn?, which provide a user-interface for controlling a device or machine using thoughts via brainwaves?

Wood, is it the only class of material from plants? Are plants, animals and fungi the only kingdoms that exist? Can you dream up a new kingdom? Can it be used?



## Base functions (not uses)

_That is, how these things do what they do_.

Reflection; refraction, projection, calculation, emission, broadcasting, sonic vibration, ...



## Uses and purposes

> _**Tip:** remember to not solve **every** issue with a magic-like tool! Then there would be no challenges for the characters to solve, no space for creative thinking, and also it would seem too unbelievable for the reader to be able to relate it to our world and their personal experiences._

> _**Another tip:** remember to create devices that would logically be invented with relation to the traditions, customs, practices, lifestyle, etc. of the people in your world._

* Calculation, conversion, translation, transference, shielding, reminding, ...
* Water purification, water mineralization
* Material purification
* Water and other material transportation (e.g. with limitless localized energy supply \[such as the non-electrons] and EMF generation, water could be contained in a vibes bottle)
* Generating fields, e.g. a dynamo creating EMF, magnetic fields, electricity, other-icity, etc.
* Measuring fields like EMF, magnetism, etc.
  * Consider usefulness for measuring magnetism. Perhaps: due to planetary alignments throughout the year, such as one planet increasing the amplitude of the magnetic field of Terra, while another planet is applying perpendicular torsion, there are certain places during certain times that are impassable and even dangerous. And, certain necessary materials resonate with the external planetary forces, so much be placed and angled correctly to be safe. These concepts produce the need for designing a device that measures all sorts of attributes of magnetic fields.
  * C\&P from notes: _applied use: checking convergences, alignments, confluences, etc with local & distal, and micro & macro & mega forces, like Feng Shui for magnetically safe architecture, room layout, roads etc, and checking the hyper interactions between the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Terra, plus how they interact with spaces on Terra. (Gaia is a different realm/layer/aspect/sphere.) At some times in the year, certain zones on Terra are impassable or high-risk zones._
* sonic healing, sonic measuring, sonic resonance, magnification of sound to make it louder or to extend its range (what are some purposes of this?).
* Reminders:
  * to use critical thinking
  * to repeat your new habits
  * habits that make your brain stronger & more resilient



## Concepts to note

* • Any types of automation will be minimal, and will still require the user/operator to think and plan a bit. This maintains a healthy level of interaction with the item, and prevents them from becoming a slave to it and/or becoming unconsciously dependent on its functioning (e.g. setting repeating alarms on a smartphone often results in
* only SOME are electrical. Electricity is just one in a class of several energetic motivator quanta. The _His Dark Materials_ universe has _anbaricity_ instead of electricity, but this is the same motive quanta and is just named after amber instead of electrum, the Latin word for amber. _Amber_ is Arabic, from Middle Persian.
* many may be free-standing, even with only one (or two) points of contact on the ground. This may be achieved by interaction with (as of yet) undetermined fields.

* If this sounds somewhat prescriptive, it's because I'm writing this as a guide for myself, and about a specific reason for worldbuilding.
