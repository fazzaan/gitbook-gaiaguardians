# Forget the Galaxy

_Guardians of the Galaxy_ is a bit of a reach when we can't even manage to take care of our current — and only — home planet.

Enter _Guardians of Gaia_.

That's us, including you.

We need you, and you need you too, we all need all of us together to look after the Earth.

It has become abundantly clear that none of the governments nor corporations are really doing anything of note regarding taking care of even the tiniest parts of Nature. Not to mention all the billionaires and wars and all the impact they're making, singlehandedly responsible for perhaps the majority of the pollution & destruction we live in.

But you know that already, and that's why you're here.

{% hint style="success" %}
The non-Marvel style heroes,

The ones who are knowledgeable, skilful, passionate, driven, communal,

That's who we need to become.

**We HAVE to be better, stronger, and more resilient than the ones who are wilfully destroying the planet.**
{% endhint %}

## Vision

We're here to gather passion, ideas, science, statistics, plans, and more.

We create initiation packs, full of information about&#x20;

* what humanity is doing to the Earth,&#x20;
* the projected futures and what seems likely to happen if we don't do enough;
* what we can do about it,&#x20;
* the possible outcomes of our actions,&#x20;
* and how to adapt to the potential & inevitable changes.

We are bringing us all together in unity. We are building community, humans function in collaboration.

## The Core of the Problem?

We need to be doing SO MUCH MORE than what's being done now.

Even when we see the best-laid plans from our governments, it is always the _**bare minimum**_.

_To be economic_ in lifestyle is to be thrifty, efficient, waste no money.

But _being economic_ with everything is exactly what got us into this situation.

Always trying to cut costs, to save money, to save resources. What if we instead were to pump excess money and resources into the development of clean energy supplies, into cleaning up the environment, into developing clean materials for products, packaging, machinery?

Our current way of life is wasteful and damages Nature precisely because we are not "wasting" resources on the things that matter.

There are a tonne of uncomfortable truths beneath this, all intertwined. To overcome our current human issues, we're gonna have to go through a Dark Night of the Soul and face these truths. The more of us who do it, the more it will spread through the collective awareness and thus the faster the shift will happen.

## Uncomfortable Truths

### Consumption

Consumption is normal, it is a natural and necessary part of being alive.

Over-consumption is common, a result of various factors.

Hyper-consumption is what we currently live inside. And when you analyze it, you will see clearly that we are continuously lured, pressured and deceived into consuming as much as humanly possible.

That's not to say that we don't have the power to control ourselves, but psychology and neurobiology are being weaponized against us, and have been for decades. We have been trained into an endless cycle of heavy, hyperactive consumptionism.

### Wealth

One of the most basic ways of creating wealth is to find something that people need and then hoard it.&#x20;

It is that simple.

Of course, there's a whole load more that goes with that...

Exploring, finding the stuff, claiming the stuff, transporting the stuff... And then protecting the stuff, and protecting the ~~people who are taking it~~ thieves, storing the stuff, controlling the source, controlling the broader location around the source...

Which leads us to:

## Invasion & Colonialism

Invasion & colonialism generally demands several things: erasure of local identity, replacement of language and religion, and the rewriting of local history. Sometimes this is achieved through syncretism instead, which makes the locals feel more comfortable with the new ways.

The most obvious forms of invasion & colonialism are military & navy invasion of foreign lands, and the establishment of colonies or outposts (which may develop into colonies eventually). There are countless examples of stolen land, colonized land, and colonial states which persist to this day.

But it also happens at the corporate level, in which a company enters a space outside of their territory.

Maybe a successful business, opening a new branch in another town or village, which might displace one or some local businesses.

Maybe a company launching a new office in a foreign country.

Maybe an energy production corporation, establishing resource ventures in foreign lands, looking to suck all the resources out of those countries, funnelling all profits back to themselves and their home countries, with no intention of paying the local workers or landowners well or even fairly.

And therein even lies the perhaps more-philosophical question of land ownership and...

## The Dominion over Nature

Are we loving Nature, or are we controlling Her in&#x20;
