# Resistance

_What **is** resistance, really?_

_When something is pushing something else, and that something else is pushing back somehow, therein lies resistance. A change in a specific way is being attempted, and someone or something is resisting it._

_Not all changes are inherently good or inherently bad._



Resistance is indeed a form of Rebellion, in and of itself.



There is a social and œconomic order that They want us to live by, and we can be a part of changing the world by resisting this order as much as possible, feasible and reasonable.

Note that: feasible and reasonable.

Do not hurt yourself in this. We all have limitations and requirements.

You _need_ to take care of yourself, your family, your children, your friends. That is the foundation of community.

Resistance in our lifestyle is about changing things in a way that doesn't damage or destroy our lives and community. To continue to resist, we have to also be in good health, on every level.

In the last few years, social media has become an exceptional channel for the distribution of ideas about all these kinds of things. It is truly amazing that so many accounts have managed to gain traction & volume, and spread their ideas far and wide.

## Don't take the buck

There are many ways we can resist but we also have to recognize that the vast majority of issues are _not_ actually our fault. Yes, we can be responsible and accountable for our actions and choices, but we can only live within our means and within the structure that is available to us — or go outside of it, which requires incredible effort, time, energy and preparation, and often a separation from our friends & family.

The largest contributors to pollution at the global level have been carefully crafting their own propaganda to use against us for literally decades — and it works. They've successfully transferred both the guilt _and_ the responsibility of using pollutant materials onto us, the regular folks who have absolutely no say in the matter and are given the choice of either causing pollution or missing out on things like _going to work_ and _having a car or motorbike_, etc.&#x20;

The onus has been passed to us, which more often than not is unresolvable.

However, many of the things that they've told us we can do _aren't_ wrong, so we can do some of these things if possible. It will help a bit, especially if a large minority of us start doing them. But we must also not fall under the illusion that these changes in lifestyle are _enough_. Really, it's the bare minimum.



We can think of resistance methods in magnitudes, perhaps, of how much effort & change is required on the part of the regular person.



## Where can we resist?

* the home
* the shops — choose local food, choose local shops, choose independent shops, choose sustainable products
