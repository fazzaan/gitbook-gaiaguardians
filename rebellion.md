# Rebellion

As much as they will try to convince you, rebellion is not a bad thing.

Actually, it is necessary and fundamental to survival.

Structures of order implicate the growth of Singularity, and it is into here where energy drains.

Order is not inherently bad.

Structure is not inherently wrong.

Of course, they are necessary, and they evolve naturally through various means.

But when rebellion comes, that too originates naturally.

It originates for a reason.

The rebels throughout our wild history have perhaps solely been the oppressed.

The structures of authority that govern us are _supposed_ to be challenged, distrusted, and forced to stay in their correct place. Because, any form of power and control _will always_ become stronger and overreach, edging towards totalitarian control.

This is abominable, we should keep it tamed and in check, like a dangerous beast that we allowed into our homes.

Indeed, government is just that — a dangerous beast that grows ever more powerful unless kept under control, fed correctly, cared for correctly.

Some creatures in this world are passive and gentle, but some are predatory and ferocious.

Governments and, in the modern era, corporations, are predatory.

And today we also see the rise of billionaires, a hyper-predator, the class which have both corporations _and_ governments under their thumbs.

They can be toppled, as we do see occasionally, but that requires a co-ordinated effort, and it is sorrowfully rare that we achieve such co-ordination in our society. Billionaires have their stability based through multiple ventures, stocks, corporations and markets, as well as buddying up with governments, so destabilizing them is a true challenge.

But it is a challenge that we must take on.

Up until recently, rebellion meant fighting the governments only.

A few decades ago, rebellion expanded to fighting companies and corporations, mainly in oil & related fields. Nowadays, we are also fighting data corporations, pharmaceutical corporations, and agricultural corporations. These entities steal, corrupt, and integrate control into their products and our world, some going as far as making it illegal to not use their products & services. Others make it practically impossible to live without using their products & services.

This is violence, on a realm and a scale never seen before. It goes beyond the Physical, beyond the Emotional & Mental, beyond the Religious & Spiritual — even beyond the psychological.

This violence has entered the realm of the Real and the Actual.

What do I mean?

Our realm of Action is polluted, we can barely act without coming into contact with their wares and being influenced by their intentions and demands. We can barely operate without sending them data about our activities, identity, feelings, decisions. And, worse, it is portrayed & packaged as convenience, bringing support and stability and ease into the lives of billions of people around the world who are struggling financially and socially.

But the difficulties were, and are, created by the same class.

And this is what makes them _worse_ than predators.

Because not many natural predators set traps, and certainly none set traps as enormous and complex as these. The scale, the length of time, the complexity, the illusion, the distraction, and the sheer quantity of lifeforce that they are draining from us, is beyond comparison.



Rebellion is all we have.

It will be hard, we will struggle more, maybe we will have worse finances.

We will have less time for ourselves, we will be more tired, maybe get sick more often.

Once "They" discover each of us, perhaps we will not have enough food and water and shelter.



But we are crossing thresholds inch by inch, and many of us see that it will be extremely hard to turn back once we pass certain thresholds. It is the same as the thresholds of climate change.



One excellent form of rebellion is to get yourself educated.

I have an array of free-to-access websites here that you can use to learn some things.

Digital security.

Digital freedom on the web.

Customizing your computer so that it works better for you and doesn't keep sending personal data to the mega-corporations that are controlling our world.

Science and how to become a scientist.

How to upgrade your mental processes and take control of your time and your actions.

How to get your thoughts ordered, and how to work out what you need to do.



To protect Mother Gaia, Planet Earth, we have to be strong, stable and resilient within ourselves.
